I am currently a PhD candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I'm interested in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics in general with a particular focus on semantic aspects of Computational Humour and Figurative Language Processing.

I hold an B.A.Sc in Software Engineering, an MA in Linguistics, and have several years of industry work experience as a software developer and QA tester. In my spare time I put my theories on Computational Humour into practice as a standup comedian.
